Hi, I'm Farzana Haque, sophomore in Electrical Engineering. I have taking ECE 110 & 120 so far, currently taking ECE 210 & 220. So far I've enjoyed the computer engineering classes more, but I'd prefer to do research & development in unusual electronic material after graduating so the plan right now is to graduate as an EE with a minor in Material Science & Engineering. I have high hopes for this class, can't wait to see how it goes :).
