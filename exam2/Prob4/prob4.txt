1.Explain the difference between while loop and do-while loop. (5 points)

While loop checks first before it does what's in the loop so it might not do it at all.
Do-while does it, then checks so definitely does the loop at least one.



2.Explain when you can use binary search and its advantage over linear search. (5 points)

You can only use binary search for an ordered list. It looks at the middle first and then checks whether the # is = middle, if it's less it in the 1st half, if it's greater than the middle it's in the 2nd half of the list so you can immediately skip checking 1/2 of the list. Then it keeps on doing this so instead of you checking every item until you reach it (linear search) this method is a lot faster.
